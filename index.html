<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Mr Bennet replied that he had not and went about his morning business of dagger sharpening and musket polishing for attacks by the unmentionables had grown alarmingly frequent in recent weeks.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Why my dear you must know Mrs Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr Morris immediately that he is to take possession before Michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Is he married or single?</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> How can it affect them?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> My dear Mr Bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Can he train them in the ways of swordsmanship and musketry?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> How can you be so tiresome!</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Marriage?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> In times such as these?</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> It is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I see no occasion for that.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them Mr Bingley may like you the best of the party.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> My dear you flatter me.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I certainly have had my share of beauty but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> When a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> In such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But my dear you must indeed go and see Mr Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It is more than I engage for I assure you.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But consider your daughters.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no newcomers.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You are over scrupulous surely.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I dare say Mr Bingley will be very glad to see you and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I desire you will do no such thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Lizzy is not a bit better than the others and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane nor half so good humoured as Lydia.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But you are always giving her the preference.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> They have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> And besides we mustnt busy the roads more than is absolutely necessary lest we lose more horses and carriages to the unfortunate scourge that has so troubled our beloved Hertfordshire of late.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> But consider your daughters!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I am considering them silly woman!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I would much prefer their minds be engaged in the deadly arts than clouded with dreams of marriage and fortune as your own so clearly is!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Go and see this Bingley if you must though I warn you that none of our girls has much to recommend them they are all silly and ignorant like their mother the exception being Lizzy who has something more of the killer instinct than her sisters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mr Bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  You take delight in vexing me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  You have no compassion for my poor nerves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  You mistake me my dear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I have a high respect for your nerves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  They are my old friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Ah you do not know what I suffer.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But I hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty I will visit them all.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mr Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I have heard of little else these last twenty years at least.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Mr Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and self discipline that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Her mind was less difficult to develop.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  She was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Chapter 2 Mr Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr Bingley.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> And when she was nervous as she was nearly all the time since the first outbreak of the strange plague in her youth she sought solace in the comfort of the traditions which now seemed mere trifles to others.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The business of Mr Bennetts life was to keep his daughters alive.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The business of Mrs Bennetts was to get them married.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> CHAPTER 2 MR.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> BENNET WAS AMONG the earliest of those who waited on Mr Bingley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  He had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  It was then disclosed in the following manner.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with I hope Mr Bingley will like it Lizzy.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Observing his second daughter employed in carving the Bennett crest in the handle of a new sword he suddenly addressed her with I hope Mr Bingley will like it Lizzy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  We are not in a way to know what Mr Bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But you forget mamma said Elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that Mrs Long promised to introduce him.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I do not believe Mrs Long will do any such thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She has two nieces of her own.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She is a selfish hypocritical woman and I have no opinion of her.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> No more have I said Mr Bennet and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> But you forget mamma said Elizabeth that we shall meet him at the next ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mrs Bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Dont keep coughing so Kitty for Heavens sake!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Have a little compassion on my nerves.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You tear them to pieces.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I do not cough for my own amusement replied Kitty fretfully.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> You sound as if you have been stricken!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Mother!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> What a dreadful thing to say with so many zombies about!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> replied Kitty fretfully.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  When is your next ball to be Lizzy?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  To morrow fortnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Aye so it is cried her mother and Mrs Long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce Mr Bingley to her.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Impossible Mr Bennet impossible when I am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teasing?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I honour your circumspection.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> A fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But if we do not venture somebody else will and after all Mrs Long and her daughters must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office I will take it on myself.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The girls stared at their father.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mrs Bennet said only Nonsense nonsense!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> cried he.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I cannot quite agree with you there.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> What say you Mary?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> For you are a young lady of deep reflection I know and read great books and make extracts.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mary wished to say something sensible but knew not how.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> While Mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to Mr Bingley.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I am sick of Mr Bingley cried his wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me that before?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Aye so it is cried her mother and it will be impossible to introduce him since we shall not know him ourselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Oh how I wish I had never heard the name Bingley!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I am sorry to hear that said Mr Bennett.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  It is very unlucky but as I have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of Mrs Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  How good it was in you my dear Mr Bennet!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  But I knew I should persuade you at last.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Well how pleased I am!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Do not mistake my indulgence for a relaxation in discipline said Mr Bennett.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The girls shall continue their training as ever Bingley or no Bingley.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Of course of course!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> cried Mrs Bennett.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> They shall be as deadly as they are fetching!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Now Kitty you may cough as much as you choose said Mr Bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  What an excellent father you have girls!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  said she when the door was shut.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> At our time of life it is not so pleasant I can tell you to be making new acquaintances every day but for your sakes we would do anything.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Such joys are scarce since the good Lord saw fit to shut the gates of Hell and doom the dead to walk amongst us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Lydia my love though you are the youngest I dare say Mr Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Oh!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> said Lydia stoutly I am not afraid for though I am the youngest Im the tallest.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr Bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> said Lydia stoutly I am not afraid for though I am the youngest Im also the most proficient in the art of tempting the other sex.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon Mr Bingley would return Mr Bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Chapter 3 Not all that Mrs Bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr Bingley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  They attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Her report was highly favourable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Sir William had been delighted with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> He was quite young wonderfully handsome and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next ball with a large party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Nothing could be more delightful!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of Mr Bingleys heart were entertained.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield said Mrs Bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married I shall have nothing to wish for.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> And if I can see all five of them survive Englands present difficulties then neither shall I he replied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  In a few days Mr Bingley returned Mr Bennets visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty and fighting skill he had heard much but he saw only the father.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat rode a black horse and carried a French carbine rifle upon his back quite an exotic weapon for an Englishman.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> However from his clumsy wielding of it Elizabeth was quite certain that he had little training in musketry or any of the deadly arts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had Mrs Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mr Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mrs Bennet was quite disconcerted.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from London his five sisters and a cousin.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether Mr Bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  Mr Bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> His sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> His brother in law Mr Hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr Bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> His sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion but little in the way of combat training.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> His brother in law Mr Hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having slaughtered more than a thousand unmentionables since the fall of Cambridge.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr Bingley and he was looked at with great admiration until his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mr Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> What a contrast between him and his friend!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mr Darcy danced only once with Mrs Hurst and once with Miss Bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> His character was decided.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> And though he lacked Mr Darcys proficiency with both sword and musket such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> What a contrast!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Mr Darcy was the proudest most disagree able man in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs Bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time Mr Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr Bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Come Darcy said he I must have you dance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You had much better dance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I certainly shall not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  You know how I detest it unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I would not be so fastidious as you are cried Mr Bingley for a kingdom!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Upon my honour I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Upon my honour!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> cried Mr Bingley I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said Mr Darcy looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Oh!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and I dare say very agreeable.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Which do you mean?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said She is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mr Bingley followed his advice.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mr Darcy walked off and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> As Mr Darcy walked off Elizabeth felt her blood turn cold.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> She had never in her life been so insulted.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The warrior code demanded she avenge her honour.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Elizabeth reached down to her ankle taking care not to draw attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> There her hand met the dagger concealed beneath her dress.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> She meant to follow this proud Mr Darcy outside and open his throat.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> But no sooner had she grabbed the handle of her weapon than a chorus of screams filled the assembly hall immediately joined by the shattering of window panes.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Unmentionables poured in their movements clumsy yet swift their burial clothing in a range of untidiness.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Some wore gowns so tattered as to render them scandalous other wore suits so filthy that one would assume they were assembled from little more than dirt and dried blood.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Their flesh was in varying degrees of putrefaction the freshly stricken were slightly green and pliant whereas the longer dead were grey and brittle their eyes and tongues long since turned to dust and their lips pulled back into everlasting skeletal smiles.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> A few of the guests who had the misfortune of being too near the windows were seized and feasted on at once.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> When Elizabeth stood she saw Mrs Long struggle to free herself as two female dreadfuls bit into her head cracking her skull like a walnut and sending a shower of dark blood spouting as high as the chandeliers.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> As guests fled in every direction Mr Bennetts voice cut through the commotion.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Girls!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Pentagram of Death!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Elizabeth immediately joined her four sisters Jane Mary Catherine and Lydia in the center of the dance floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Each girl produced a dagger from her ankle and stood at the tip of an imaginary five pointed star.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> From the center of the room they began stepping outward in unison each thrusting a razor sharp dagger with one hand the other hand modestly tucked into the small of her back.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> From a corner of the room Mr Darcy watched Elizabeth and her sisters work their way outward beheading zombie after zombie as they went.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> He knew of only one other woman in all of Great Britain who wielded a dagger with such skill such grace and deadly accuracy.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> By the time the girls reached the walls of the assembly hall the last of the unmentionables lay still.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Apart from the attack the evening altogether passed off pleasantly for the whole family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mrs Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mr Bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Elizabeth felt Janes pleasure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> They found Mr Bennet still up.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> With a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to Jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since Jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> When she is secure of him there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  Elizabeth Bennet said Miss Bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men I dare say it succeeds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  But in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Undoubtedly replied Darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Bingley urged Mr Jones being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I did not know before continued Bingley immediately that you were a studier of character.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It must be an amusing study.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Yes but intricate characters are the most amusing.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> They have at least that advantage.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The country said Darcy can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I hardly knew you to possess such character said Bingley.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> My own character is of little consequence replied Elizabeth.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I devote a great many hours to the study of it.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Excepting of course when the country is overrun with the same unmentionables as town.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country particularly since the wall was built.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> It may be a fortress replete with shops but it is a fortress nonetheless and hardly fit for the fragile nerves of a gentle lady.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink">The country is a vast deal pleasanter is it not Mr Bingley?</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> For while I sleep more soundly in the safety of town I find my general disposition much improved by my present surroundings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Aye that is because you have the right disposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  But that gentleman looking at Darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Indeed Mamma you are mistaken said Elizabeth blushing for her mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  You quite mistook Mr Darcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town which you must acknowledge to be true.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Just as Mr Darcy would surely acknowledge that the scarcity of graveyards makes the country altogether more agreeable in times such as these.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Certainly my dear but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I know we dine with four and twenty families.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> His sister was less delicate and directed her eyes towards Mr Darcy with a very expressive smile.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Yes she called yesterday with her father.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> What an agreeable man Sir William is Mr Bingley is not he?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> So much the man of fashion!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> So genteel and easy!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He had always something to say to everybody.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> That is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Did Charlotte dine with you?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> No she would go home.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> For my part Mr Bingley I always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up very differently.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But everybody is to judge for themselves and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls I assure you.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It is a pity they are not handsome!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Not that I think Charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She seems a very pleasant young woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Oh!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> dear yes but you must own she is very plain.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Lady Lucas herself has often said so and envied me Janes beauty.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure Jane one does not often see anybody better looking.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It is what everybody says.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I do not trust my own partiality.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> When she was only fifteen there was a man at my brother Gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But however he did not.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Perhaps he thought her too young.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> However he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> And so ended his affection said Elizabeth impatiently.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> There has been many a one I fancy overcome in the same way.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said Darcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Of a fine stout healthy love it may.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Everything nourishes what is strong already.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Well three and twenty I suppose God rest poor Mrs Longs soul.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  She longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence Mrs Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr Bingley for his kindness to Jane with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mr Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  She performed her part indeed without much graciousness but Mrs Bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax Mr Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attention of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> She had every bit of Lizzys deadly nature though little of her sense and had vanquished her first unmentionable at the remarkable age of seven and one half years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  She was very equal therefore to address Mr Bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear I am perfectly ready I assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  Lydia declared herself satisfied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Oh!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  And when you have given your ball she added I shall insist on their giving one also.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mrs Bennet and her daughters then departed and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr Darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all Miss Bingleys witticisms on fine eyes.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of yours.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  They are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  It is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> My style of writing is very different from yours.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Oh!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> cried Miss Bingley Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He leaves out half his words and blots the rest.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Your humility Mr Bingley said Elizabeth must disarm reproof.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Nothing is more deceitful said Darcy than the appearance of humility.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> When you told Mrs Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Nay cried Bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> And yet upon my honour I believe what I said of myself to be true and I believe it at this moment.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> At least therefore I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I dare say you believed it but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say Bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You have only proved by this cried Elizabeth that Mr Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You have shown him off now much more than he did himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I am exceedingly gratified said Bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think better of me if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as I could.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Would Mr Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter Darcy must speak for himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine but which I have never acknowledged.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember Miss Bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> To yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You appear to me Mr Darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr Bingley.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> We may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> By all means cried Bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument Miss Bennet than you may be aware of.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself I should not pay him half so much deference.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mr Darcy smiled but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I see your design Bingley said his friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You dislike an argument and want to silence this.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Perhaps I do.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Arguments are too much like disputes.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room I shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> What you ask said Elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and Mr Darcy had much better finish his letter.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mr Darcy took her advice and did finish his letter.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> When that business was over he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mrs Hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently Mr Darcys eyes were fixed on her.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Miss Bingley played next varying the charm by a lively Scotch air and soon afterwards Mr Darcy drawing near Elizabeth said to her Do not you feel a great inclination Miss Bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?</td></tr>

<tr><td>  He repeated the question with some surprise at her silence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Oh!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  said she I heard you before but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  You wanted me I know to say Yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I have therefore made up my mind to tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Indeed I do not dare.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  Miss Bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after officers.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> And if I may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check Miss Bennets unladylike affinity for guns and swords and exercise and all those silly things best left to men or ladies of low breeding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Oh!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> yes.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Put them next to your great uncle the judge.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> They are in the same profession you know only in different lines.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> As for your Elizabeths picture you must not have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be copied.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs Hurst and Elizabeth herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I did not know that you intended to walk said Miss Bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I did not know that you intended to walk said Miss Bingley in some confusion lest she had been overheard.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  The path just admitted three.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mr Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said This walk is not wide enough for our party.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  We had better go into the avenue.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  But Elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered No no stay where you are.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  You are charmingly grouped and appear to uncommon advantage.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Besides that path is most assuredly rife with zombies and I have not the inclination to engage in fighting them off to day.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  They stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  He smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Very well.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Sometimes.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> One must speak a little you know.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Both replied Elizabeth archly for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> We are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> On the contrary I find that balls are much more enjoyable when they cease to remain private.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> He made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often meet with zombies on their walks to Meryton.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  The effect was immediate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and Elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  At length Darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said Mr Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied Elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  I have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Such very superior dancing is not often seen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  It is evident that you belong to the first circles.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear Eliza glancing at her sister and Bingley shall take place.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I appeal to Mr Darcy but let me not interrupt you sir.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy but Sir Williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane who were dancing together.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said Sir Williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> But let me not interrupt you sir.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> We may compare our different opinions.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence and on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in Darcys breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you among his other communication that he was the son of old Wickham the late Mr Darcys steward.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to Mr Darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has always been remarkably kind to him though George Wickham has treated Mr Darcy in a most infamous manner.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I do not know the particulars but I know very well that Mr Darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and I wonder how he could presume to do it.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I pity you Miss Eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said Elizabeth angrily for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr Darcys steward and of that I can assure you he informed me himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I beg your pardon replied Miss Bingley turning away with a sneer.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Excuse my interference it was kindly meant.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Insolent girl!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> said Elizabeth to herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr Darcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She then sought her eldest sister who has undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for Wickham resentment against his enemies and everything else gave way before the hope of Janes being in the fairest way for happiness.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sisters what you have learnt about Mr Wickham.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  No replied Jane I have not forgotten him but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mr Bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr Darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that Mr Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr Darcy than he has received and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sisters Mr Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Now do you wish to cause a stir or shall we to the kitchen?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Mr Bingley led the two of them down a hidden staircase and into the cellar which was divided into two halves by a long corridor one side belonging to the servants quarters and armory the other to the exercise parlor and kitchen.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> It was in the latter that a most unfortunate sight awaited them.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Mr Bingley observed the desserts his poor servants had been attending to at the time of their demise a delightful array of tarts exotic fruits and pies sadly soiled by blood and brains and thus unusable.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I dont suppose said Darcy that you would give me the honour of dispensing of this unhappy business alone.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and Elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Others of the party were now applied to.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> If I said Mr Collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing I should have great pleasure I am sure in obliging the company with an air for I consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The rector of a parish has much to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> In the first place he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manner towards everybody especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I cannot acquit him of that duty nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> And with a bow to Mr Darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Many stared many smiled but no one looked more amused than Mr Bennet himself while his wife seriously commended Mr Collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to Lady Lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> To Elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> That his two sisters and Mr Darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  She was at least free from the offense of Mr Darcys further notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of Mrs Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mrs Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> They repulsed every attempt of Mrs Bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr Collins who was complimenting Mr Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Darcy said nothing at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mr Bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mr Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs Hurst or Miss Bingley and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of Lord how tired I am!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> accompanied by a violent yawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  When at length they arose to take leave Mrs Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn and addressed herself especially to Mr Bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from London whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mrs Bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from London whither he was obliged to go the next day for a meeting of the Society of Gentlemen for a Peaceful Solution to Our Present Difficulties of which he was a member and patron.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The first was a young freshly dead female in a white lace wedding gown which like her skin was surprisingly white almost shockingly so save for the bright red rubies that dripped from her mouth and onto the lace covering her bosom.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Elizabeth and Jane aimed and discharged their muskets Janes ball finding one of the creatures eyes and Elizabeths striking its neck cutting through the brittle flesh and separating head from body.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> These zombies were followed by several more each vanquished as quickly as the last until the cracking of powder at last fell silent.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Sensing the danger passed the sisters lowered their barrels and spoke of setting off again for Meryton.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> But these plans were belated by a most unusual noise from beyond the tree line.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> It was a shrill shrieking neither human nor animal and yet unlike any zombie wail the sisters had ever heard.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> It grew closer and once again all muskets were trained and readied.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> A long dead female zombie stumbled out of the woods her modest clothing slightly tattered her brittle hair pulled back so tightly that it had begun to tear the skin of her forehead.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> In her arms she held something exceedingly rare something none of the sisters had ever seen or ever wished to see an unmentionable infant.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> It clawed at the females flesh emitting a most unpleasant series of shrieks.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> She trained her sights on the elders head her finger caressing the trigger.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> She would put it down reload and dispense of them both.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> And yet.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink">.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> she did not.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> There was a strange force at work a feeling she faintly recalled from her earliest days before she had first traveled to Shaolin.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> It was a curious feeling something akin to shame but without the dishonor of defeat a shame that demanded no vengeance.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Could there be honor in mercy?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> she wondered.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> It contradicted everything she had been taught every warrior instinct she possessed.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Hopelessly bemused Elizabeth lowered her musket and the zombies continued into the woods until they were seen no more.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> It was agreed that none of them would ever speak of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Wickham joined the sisters on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and concern upon hearing of the regrettable fate of Mr Bingley s household staff was well talked over.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand and Elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I will read it to you When my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but I will not leave the country without confiding them and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> My brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisters partiality is not misleading me I think when I call Charles most capable of engaging any womans heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister and we are scarcely less eager to meet her again.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  What do you think of this sentence my dear Lizzy?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  said Jane as she finished it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Is it not clear enough?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  to put me on my guard?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Can there be any other opinion on the subject?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Yes there can for mine is totally different.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Will you hear it?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Most willingly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  You shall have it in a few words.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I dare say she means to keep you from his attentions.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink">Your honour demands she be slain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Jane shook her head.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Indeed Jane you ought to believe me.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> You forget yourself Lizzy.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Jane no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Miss Bingley I am sure cannot.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She is not such a simpleton.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Could she have seen half as much love in Mr Darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But the case is this We are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and I dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But my dearest Jane you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> If we thought alike of Miss Bingley replied Jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But I know the foundation is unjust.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> That is right.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Believe her to be deceived by all means.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But my dear sister can I be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You must decide for yourself said Elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife I advise you by all means to refuse him.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> How can you talk so?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> said Jane faintly smiling.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation I could not hesitate.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I did not think you would and that being the case I cannot consider your situation with much compassion.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> A thousand things may arise in six months!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> They agreed that Mrs Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> She may not be a warrior but she has cunning enough.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Dearest sister I implore you this unhappiness is best remedied by the hasty application of a cutlass to her throat.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> If we thought alike replied Jane my honour would be restored at the expense of losing Mr Bingleys affections forever.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> And what pray would be the purpose?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Caroline is incapable of willfully deceiving anyone and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Is it she who is deceived or you?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> You forget yourself Jane you have allowed your feelings for Mr Bingley to soften the instincts bestowed by our Oriental masters.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Though they could not agree on a course of action Jane and Elizabeth agreed that Mrs Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  After lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation that Mr Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Chapter 22 The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr Collins.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It keeps him in good humour said she and I am more obliged to you than I can express.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied Why should you be surprised my dear Eliza?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Do you think it incredible that Mr Collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But Elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  Mr Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  He was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mrs Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> It was too long since her eyes had been filled with the delights of London which though quarantined by towering walls and divided into sections by the Kings army was still a city unrivaled in its ability to excite the senses.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> My dear aunt how could you think of it?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mr Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it Mr Bingley never stirs without him.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She will not be able to help calling.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of Bingleys being withheld from seeing Jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Miss Bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped by Carolines not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> To work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  As the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Every park has its beauty and its prospects and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as Mr Collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self importance and brought Mr Wickham immediately to Elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> When after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr Darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in Marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by Sir William who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  A great deal more passed at the other table.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Sir William did not say much.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Lady Catherine gave no acknowledgment and Mr Collins and Sir William were too engrossed in their game to notice what happened next.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Elizabeth immediately excused herself rose and taking care not to draw attention grabbed Charlotte by the arm and escorted her to the toilette where she watched her stricken friend suffer through a quarter hour of a sickness so severe that decorum prevents its description in these pages.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  As soon as they had driven from the door Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings which for Charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy Mr Collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> While Sir William was with them Mr Collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of the window in his own book room which fronted the road.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a more pleasant aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for Mr Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> From the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to Mr Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with Charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Very few days passed in which Mr Collins did not walk to Rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Lady Catherine the Great had been a disappointment in every sense and Elizabeth could not forgive the slight against her temple and master.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of Sir William and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Their other engagements were few as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr Collinss reach.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> If my fighting is truly inferior then your ladyship shall be spared the trouble of watching it for very long.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Elizabeth set her feet and Lady Catherine realising she would never convince such a stubborn unusual girl snapped her fingers.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The first ninja drew his sword and let out a battle cry as he charged directly at Elizabeth.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> When his blade was only inches from her throat she moved from her opponents path and dragged her Katana across his belly.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The ninja dropped to the floor his innards spilling from the slit faster than he could stuff them back in.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Elizabeth sheathed her sword knelt behind him and strangled him to death with his own large bowel.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Lady Catherine snapped her fingers a second time and another ninja charged this one unleashing throwing stars as he advanced.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Elizabeth drew her Katana and shielded herself from the first three flying weapons then snatched the fourth out of the air and threw it back at its originator striking him in the thigh.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The ninja cried out and grabbed the wound with both hands and Elizabeth brought her blade down taking off not only the hands but the leg which they held firmly.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The ninja fell to the floor and was promptly beheaded.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Though discontented with such a beginning Lady Catherine held the greatest hopes for her third and final ninja the deadliest of the three.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> But no sooner had she snapped her fingers than Elizabeth flung her Katana across the dojo piercing the ninjas chest and pinning him against a wooden column.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Elizabeth removed her blindfold and confronted her opponent who presently clutched the sword handle gasping for breath.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> She delivered a vicious blow penetrating his rib cage and withdrew her hand with the ninjas still beating heart in it.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> As all but Lady Catherine turned away in disgust Elizabeth took a bite letting the blood run down her chin and onto her sparring gown.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Curious said Elizabeth still chewing.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I have tasted many a heart but I dare say I find the Japanese ones a bit tender.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Her ladyship left the dojo without giving compliment to Elizabeths skills.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingleys designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs Collins sat for some time without speaking to anybody.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  At length however his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  She answered him in the usual way and after a moments pause added My eldest sister has been in town these three months.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield and she blushed as she answered I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I assure you my picture of the world is rather a bit bigger than Longbourn.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  But she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  That is not an unnatural surmise said Fitzwilliam but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  This was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr Darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I had often seen him in love before.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> At that ball while I had the honour of dancing with you I was first made acquainted by Sir William Lucass accidental information that Bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> From that moment I observed my friends behaviour attentively and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> But it was not till she took ill and remained at Netherfield that I had any apprehension for knowing of her occupation as a slayer of the undead I was certain that she had been stricken with the strange plague.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Not wishing to trouble you or any of the Netherfield party with my theory I endeavoured to smother Bingleys affections thus sparing him the agony of watching your sister succumb.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  At length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while Mrs Reynolds replied that he was adding But we expect him to morrow with a large party of friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She approached and saw the likeness of Mr Wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantelpiece.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The housekeeper came forward and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman the son of her late masters musket polisher who had been brought up by him at his own expense.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  He is now gone into the army she added but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mrs Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but Elizabeth could not return it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  And that said Mrs Reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my master and very like him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  It was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I have heard much of your masters fine person said Mrs Gardiner looking at the picture it is a handsome face.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  But Lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mrs Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Does that young lady know Mr Darcy?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Elizabeth coloured and said A little.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman maam?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Yes very handsome.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I am sure I know none so handsome but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  This room was my late masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  He was very fond of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr Wickhams being among them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mrs Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy drawn when she was only eight years old.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  said Mrs Gardiner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Oh!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She plays and sings all day long.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master she comes here to morrow with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> She beheaded her first unmentionable not one month after her eleventh birthday!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I grant you Mr Darcy had chained the vile creature to a tree but it was an impressive kill nonetheless.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> In the next room is a new Katana just come for her a present from my master she comes here to morrow with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mr Gardiner whose manners were very easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks Mrs Reynolds either by pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Not so much as I could wish sir but I dare say he may spend half his time here and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Except thought Elizabeth when she goes to Ramsgate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  If your master would marry you might see more of him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Yes sir but I do not know when that will be.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I do not know who is good enough for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mr and Mrs Gardiner smiled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Elizabeth could not help saying It is very much to his credit I am sure that you should think so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I say no more than the truth and everybody will say that knows him replied the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added I have never known a cross word from him in my life and I have known him ever since he was four years old.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> In that time I have seen him savagely beat but one servant and a most deserved beating it was.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I dare say he is the gentlest man in all of Britain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  This was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  That he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying There are very few people of whom so much can be said.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  You are lucky in having such a master.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Yes sir I know I am.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  If I were to go through the world I could not meet with a better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  But I have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Elizabeth almost stared at her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Can this be Mr Darcy?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  thought she.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  His father was an excellent man said Mrs Gardiner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Yes maam that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mrs Reynolds could interest her on no other point.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She related the subjects of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain Mr Gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing but themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Some people call him proud but I am sure I never saw anything of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> To my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Kind even to the wretched accidents of God the lame and the deaf alike.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  In what an amiable light does this place him!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  thought Elizabeth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  This fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Perhaps we might be deceived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  That is not very likely our authority was too good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting room lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  He is certainly a good brother said Elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mrs Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcys delight when she should enter the room.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Mrs Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy s delight when she should enter the room.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  And this is always the way with him she added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  There is nothing he would not do for her.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The picture gallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were all that remained to be shown.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> In the former were many good paintings but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> In the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr Darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mrs Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers lifetime.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> There was certainly at this moment in Elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs Reynolds was of no trifling nature.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> As a brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> how much of good or evil must be done by him!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The battle gallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were all that remained to be shown.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> In the former were many good zombie heads and suits of Samurai armor but Elizabeth cared little for such trophies and turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcys in crayons whose subjects were almost exclusively the nude male form.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned downstairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> As they walked across the hall towards the river Elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> They were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> As the gardener led them along the river stopping to point out the occasional coy pond or stone garden Elizabeth turned back to appreciate the house from a greater distance and was met with such a shock as to make her reach for the sword that she had neglected to bring for behind them was a fast approaching herd of unmentionables no fewer than five and twenty in number.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Elizabeth her composure regained alerted her party to this unhappy development and ordered them to run and hide which they did with no shortage of alacrity.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> With the herd nearly upon her she prepared for battle ripping a branch from a nearby tree and placing her feet in the first position for the Windswept Peasant method.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Pole fighting had never been her strongest discipline but as she was otherwise unarmed it seemed the most practical approach given the large number of opponents.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The zombies let forth a most unpleasant roar as they came within biting distance and Elizabeth returned it in kind as she began her counterattack.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> But no sooner had she struck down the first five or six than the cracking of gunpowder scattered the score that remained.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Elizabeth held a defensive pose as the zombies limped hurriedly for the safety of the woods and then upon being assured of their retreat turned her gaze in the direction of the musket fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> On this she was again met with shock though of a decidedly different nature for upon a steed holding a still smoking Brown Bess was none other than the owner of the grounds on which she stood.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The smoke from Darcys musket hung in the air around him wafting Heavenward through his thick mane of chestnut hair.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> His steed let forth a mighty neigh and reared upon its hind legs high enough to throw a lesser horseman clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> But Darcys free hand held true and he coaxed the spooked beast back to earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> It was impossible to avoid his sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to Elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr Darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> He absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards her dismounted and spoke to Elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility as the rest of her party came out of hiding and joined them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn and of her having stayed in Derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> At length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  The others then joined her and expressed admiration of his figure but Elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  She was overpowered by shame and vexation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  How strange it must appear to him!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Oh!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  why did she come?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Or why did he thus come a day before he was expected?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  And his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> That he should even speak to her was amazing!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> but to speak with such civility to inquire after her family!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> That he should even come to her aid was amazing!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> But to speak to her and with such civility to inquire after her well being!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park when he put his letter into her hand!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  She knew not what to think or how to account for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House whichever it might be where Mr Darcy then was.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything she was still dear to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> At length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> They entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds when in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mr Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> They crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house Mrs Gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for Mr Gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and Elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of Mr Darcy approaching them and at no great distance.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The walk here being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> They entered the woods and ascended some of the higher grounds where the zombies with their dry muscles and brittle bones were less likely to bother them.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Mr Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be too dangerous given the propinquity of the herd.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> A nearby roar from one of Satans soldiers settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> They crossed it by a simple bridge which they were informed was assembled from the violated headstones of Pemberley.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  Elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  For a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Perhaps he had merely returned to hunt the scattered unmention bles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  With a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Her colour changed and she said no more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mrs Gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  What will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  He takes them now for people of fashion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  The introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> That he was surprised by the connection was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned his back with them and entered into conversation with Mr Gardiner.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  She listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard Mr Darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  Mrs Gardiner who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth gave her a look expressive of wonder.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating Why is he so altered?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  From what can it proceed?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  It cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It is impossible that he should still love me.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> After walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> After walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some zombie droppings there chanced to be a little alteration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  It originated in Mrs Gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found Elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mr Darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  After a short silence the lady first spoke.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left Bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  He acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  They will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you Mr Bingley and his sisters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr Bingleys name had been the last mentioned between them and if she might judge by his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> There is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  Will you allow me or do I ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  The surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  They now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  They soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage Mr and Mrs Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  He then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> At such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She wanted to talk but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> At last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn our before the tete a tete was over.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> At such a time much might have been said but nothing was.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Elizabeth and Darcy merely looked at one another in awkward silence until the latter reached both arms around her.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> She was frozen What does he mean to do?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> she thought.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> But his intentions were respectable for Darcy merely meant to retrieve his Brown Bess which Elizabeth had affixed to her back during her walk.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> She remembered the lead ammunition in her pocket and offered it to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Your balls Mr Darcy?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> He reached out and closed her hand around them and offered They belong to you Miss Bennet.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Upon this their colour changed and they were forced to look away from one another lest they laugh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  On Mr and Mrs Gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with utmost politeness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mr Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  The observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  He is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  There is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud I have seen nothing of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Such horsemanship!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Such musketry!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  It was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  To be sure Lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as Wickham or rather he has not Wickhams countenance for his features are perfectly good.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Your great men often are and therefore I shall not take him at his word as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Your great men often are and therefore I shall not take him at his word as he might change his mind another day and bludgeon me with his musket for taking trout from his stock.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character but said nothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  From what we have seen of him continued Mrs Gardiner I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  He has not an ill natured look.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  On the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Clements because Wickhams lodgings were in that parish.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Clements because it had the fewest steps to carry my beloved up.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  Well Monday morning came and I was in such a fuss!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then I should have gone quite distracted.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off for there had lately been some trouble on the east wall and everywhere one heard talk of relinquishing the neighborhood for safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  And there was my aunt all the time I was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  However I did not hear above one word in ten for I was thinking you may suppose of my dear Wickham.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat or if he had soiled it like the others.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual I thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  If youll believe me I did not once put my foot out of doors though I was there a fortnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Not one party or scheme or anything.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> To be sure London was rather thin but however the Little Theatre was open.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr Stone.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  But luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  However I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for Mr Darcy might have done as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mr Darcy!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  repeated Elizabeth in utter amazement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Oh yes!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  he was to come there with Wickham you know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  But gracious me!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I quite forgot!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I ought not to have said a word about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I promised them so faithfully!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  What will Wickham say?</td></tr>
<tr><td>  It was to be such a secret!</td></tr>
<tr><td>  If it was to be secret said Jane say not another word on the subject.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  You may depend upon my seeking no further.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Oh!</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Thank you said Lydia for if you did I should certainly tell you all and then Wickham would be angry.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Thank you said Lydia for if you did I should certainly tell you all and then Wickham would surely punish me with an ill timed soiling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  On such encouragement to ask Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mr Darcy had been at her sisters wedding.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  Pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Not that I shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall Elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante.</td></tr>

<tr><td>  MY DEAR NIECE I have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I must confess myself surprised by your application I did not expect it from you.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Dont think me angry however for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> If you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But if you are really innocent and ignorant I must be more explicit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mr Darcy called and was shut up with him several hours.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  It was all over before I arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He came to tell Mr Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr Wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both Wickham repeatedly Lydia once.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> He came to tell Mr Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr Wickham were.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  From what I can collect he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Mr Darcy felt himself to blame for not making Wickhams worthlessness more known for if he had no young woman of character would have dared love or confide in him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> His character was to speak for itself.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  He called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> If he had another motive I am sure it would never disgrace him.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  There is a lady it seems a Mrs Younge who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  She then took a large house in Edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  This Mrs Younge was he knew intimately acquainted with Wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She would not betray her trust I suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> But it was two or three minutes of savage beating before he could get from her what he wanted.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> She would not betray her trust I suppose without an application of severe blows about the head and neck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  At length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> They were in street.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He saw Wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> They were in Hens Quarry Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Mr Darcy saw Wickham and with no want of force insisted on seeing Lydia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  His first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving Wickham.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with Wickham he easily learnt had never been his design.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of Lydias flight on her own folly alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> She cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving Wickham who in spite of his abducting her she claimed to love more than anything on earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Since such were her feelings Mr Darcy had but one choice to restore her honour to secure and expedite a marriage between she and Wickham.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> But the latter had no intentions of marrying and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  He must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mr Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Though Mr Bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But he found in reply to this question that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> They met several times for there was much to be discussed.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Every thing being settled between them Mr Darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But Mr Gardiner could not be seen and Mr Darcy found on further inquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> On Saturday he came again.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Your father was gone your uncle at home and as I said before they had a great deal of talk together.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Mr Darcy asked him why he did not marry your sister at once.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Though Mr Bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would be able to do something for him and his situ ation would be benefited by marriage.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> But he found in reply to this question that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage into a family of greater means.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Mr Darcy saw an opportunity here and met with Wickham again to propose a solution beneficial to all parties.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Mr Wickham after a great deal of consideration agreed.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Every thing being settled between them Mr Darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with the arrangement and he first called in Section Six East the evening before I came home and they had a great deal of talk together.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  They met again on Sunday and then I saw him too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  It was not all settled before Monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to Longbourn.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But our visitor was very obstinate.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I fancy Lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink">The terms were as follows Wickhams debts were to be paid amounting I believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds plus another thousand per annum to sustain him.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> In return he would marry Lydia thus restoring her honour and that of the Bennet family.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Second he would allow Mr Darcy to render him lame as punishment for a lifetime of vice and betrayal and to ensure that he would never lay another hand in anger nor leave another bastard behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> To spare what little of his reputation remained the injuries would be attributed to a carriage accident.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Finally he would pursue the priesthood in hopes that the teachings of Christ would improve his general character.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Darcy personally saw to it that all of this was attended to with the greatest expedience.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I dare say he took particular pleasure in beating Mr Wickham lame.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I fancy Lizzy that stubbornness is the real defect of his character after all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  He has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though I am sure and I do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> They battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> He insisted on shouldering the entire burden himself though I am sure and I do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> He and your uncle battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  But at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  But Lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or Jane at most.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You know pretty well I suppose what has been done for the young people.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> His debts are to be paid amounting I believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  The reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as I have given above.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that Wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Perhaps there was some truth in this though I doubt whether his reserve or anybodys reserve can be answerable for the event.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But in spite of all this fine talking my dear Lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> It was owing to him to his reserve that Wickhams character had been so misunderstood.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Perhaps there was some truth in this though I doubt whether his reserve or anybodys reserve can be answerable to anything so scandalous.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> But in spite of all this fine talking my dear Lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not been convinced of Mr Darcys having another interest in the affair.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  When all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at Pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I believe I have now told you every thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Lydia came to us and Wickham had constant admission to the house.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He was exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if I had not perceived by Janes letter last Wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> If she heard me it was by good luck for I am sure she did not listen.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I was sometimes quite provoked but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane and for their sakes had patience with her.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Lydia came to us and Wickham newly lame was carried to the house to recover and to be fitted for his traveling bed which Mr Darcy gener ously paid for.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with your sisters behaviour while she remained with us if I had not perceived by Janes letter last Wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly as reprehensible and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mr Darcy was punctual in his return and as Lydia informed you attended the wedding.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Will you be very angry with me my dear Lizzy if I take this opportunity of saying what I was never bold enough to say before how much I like him.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> He dined with us the next day gave his congratulations to the new couple and took leave.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Will you be very angry with me my dear Lizzy if I take this opportunity of saying how much I like him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  His behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  His understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  I thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Your ladyship wants Mr Darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Allow me to say Lady Catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You have widely mistaken my character if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs I cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> You have no regard for the honour and credit of my nephew!</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You refuse then to oblige me.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> You refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied Elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr Darcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> And with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> And this is your real opinion!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> This is your final resolve!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Very well.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I shall now know how to act.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Do not imagine Miss Bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I came to try you.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it I will carry my point.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> In this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added I take no leave of you Miss Bennet.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Lady Catherines eyes widened as she felt a sharp pain in her belly.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> She let go and stumbled backward the handle of Elizabeths dagger protruding from her gown.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The younger took full advantage of this confusion striking her ladyship about the head neck and bosom with a severe combination of blows and a final kick which drove her so high as to shatter two of the wooden rafters overhead.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Elizabeth stood over her waiting for any sign of life but none appeared.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Dear Lord she thought.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> How shall Darcy ever forgive me for killing his beloved aunt?</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The thought was no sooner in her head than Elizabeth felt herself fall to the ground brought down by Lady Catherines legs.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The latter leapt to her feet and with a hearty laugh pulled the dagger from her belly and flung it into Elizabeths hand pinning her to the floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> It would take skills far exceeding your own to draw but a single bead of exercise moisture from my skin.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Weak silly girl!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> So long as there is life in this old body you shall never again be in the company of my nephew!</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Remain thus dear ninjas.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> When I have removed her head you may do with the body as you please.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> As Elizabeth struggled to free herself her ladyship removed one of the swords from the wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> She unsheathed it and examined its glistening blade.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Remarkable.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> As fine a Katana as ever I saw in Kyoto.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Lady Catherine looked up from the blade expecting to see her opponent.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Instead she saw nothing nothing but an empty dojo and a pair of broken lifeless ninjas.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> She met this too with a hearty laugh.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> What good fun!</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I must admit had you been vanquished with so little effort I should have been rather disappointed.</td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mr Darcys letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what Mr Bennet sent to Mr Collins in reply to his last.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> DEAR SIR I must trouble you once more for congratulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr Darcy.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But if I were you I would stand by the nephew.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He has more to give.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Yours sincerely etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Miss Bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> She wrote even to Jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brothers in sending it.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Before any answer could arrive from Mr Collins or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that Charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> At such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw Mr Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He bore it however with admirable calmness.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He could even listen to Sir William Lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Jamess with very decent composure.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> If he did shrug his shoulders it was not till Sir William was out of sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mrs Phillipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though Mrs Phillips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingleys good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved and trained by her sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Chapter 61 Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs Bingley and talked of Mrs Darcy may be guessed.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I wish I could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> With what delighted pride she afterwards visited the new Mrs Bingley and talked of the new Mrs Darcy may be guessed.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I wish I could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of seeing so many of her children happily settled made her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who took such pleasure in teasing her that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mr Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  He delighted in going to Pemberley especially when he was least expected.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> As Mr Bennet had predicted Hertfordshire also longed for the company of its two fiercest protectors.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> In the days and months proceeding with only two of the younger Bennet sisters to ward them off the zombies descended in ever greater numbers until Colonel Forster returned with the militia and set the burning grounds afire once more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Mr Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire and Jane and Elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Jane could not bear to be so close to Longbourn as a married woman for every unmentionable attack made her long for her sword.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> The darling wish of Mr Bingleys sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire and Jane and Elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Determined that they should keep their skills sharp though His Majesty no longer required them to do so their husbands built them a sparring cottage precisely between the two estates in which the sisters met joyously and often.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  In society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia and removed from the influence of Lydias example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> From the further disadvantage of Lydias society she was of course carefully kept and though Mrs Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs Bennets being quite unable to sit alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> When she announced that she should like to return to Shaolin for two or three years in hopes of becoming as fine a warrior as Elizabeth Mr Darcy was only too happy to pay for the whole.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Mary was the only daughter who remained at home both by the necessity of there being at least one warrior to protect Hertfordshire and Mrs Bennets being quite unable to sit alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> As she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own Mary began to mix more with the world eventually taking up rather intimate infrequent friendships with several soldiers of the returned militia.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  As for Wickham and Lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> In spite of every thing they were not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make Wickhams fortune.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  The letter was to this effect MY DEAR LIZZY I wish you joy.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> If you love Mr Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham you must be very happy.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> If you love Mr Darcy half as well as I do my Dear lame Wickham you must be very happy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  It is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do I hope you will think of us.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to Mr Darcy about it if you had rather not.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I am sure Wickham would like a parsonage very much when he is finished at seminary and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Any parsonage would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to Mr Darcy about it if you had rather not.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> I must be off as my beloved has soiled himself anew.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Yours etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> His affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley yet for Elizabeths sake he assisted him further in his profession.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even Bingleys good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Elizabeth endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Such relief however as it was in her power to afford in the form of fresh linens and salted beef she frequently sent them.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever Wickhams studies required the purchase of a new hymnal for the lame or lectern for the lame or altar for the lame either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley for Elizabeths sake he assisted him further in his profession.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to minister in the asylums of London and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long that even Bingleys good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcys marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of Georgiana almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Pemberley was now Georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.</td></tr>
<tr><td>  They were able to love each other even as well as they intended.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> He who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> By Elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of Elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> But at length by Elizabeths persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> With the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightgreen"> Darcy as well as Elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into Derbyshire had been the means of uniting them.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother and cringed at her tales of ripping the beating hearts from the chests of untold enemies.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Through Elizabeths instructions Miss Darcy became a finer warrior than she ever dared hope for beyond improving her musketry and bladesmanship she also began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement came not in written form but in the form of an attack on Pemberley by five and ten of her ladyships ninjas.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> For some time after this was thwarted all intercourse was at an end.</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="pink"> But at length by Elizabeths persuasion he was prevailed on to seek a reconciliation and after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt with whom Darcy and Elizabeth were always on the most intimate terms.</td></tr>
